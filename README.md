All content are made by me.
It contains:
<ul>
  <li>CSS animations</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Slides</li>
  <li>DOM</li>
</ul>

I could use `<section>` element i din't used due bein useless in this context.

## What do i plan next.
I took some notations what i missed in this simple webpage.
<ul>
  <li>Make mobile support.</li>
  <li>Light-dark.</li>
  <li>Use more DOM.</li>
  <li>Attempt to connect to an backend.</li>
  <li>Actually use section.</li>
</ul>
